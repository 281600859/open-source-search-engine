"somewhere in albuquerque there's a 1 person company that produces extremely efficient, fast and insanely flexible search product. we use it for an extra-secret BI project and been up and running in less than an hour. with matt nearby is like having a top google engineer tweak and improve your very own search engine. thank you matt for everything you've done for us!"
