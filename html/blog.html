<i>Aug 17, 2013</i><br><br>
This week I have begin constructing a tool that allows you to compare Gigablasts with Solr and Elasticsearch, which are two of the more popular open-source search engines on the market today. Both of those are based on Lucene. So essentially I will be comparing everything I think is noteworth, if I leave something out drop me an email.
